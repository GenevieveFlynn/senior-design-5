# Web3 and Ethereum Querying Resources

### Web3
1. [Web3.js - Ethereum JavaScript API](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.11/index.html) - web3.js is a collection of libraries that allow you to interact with a local or remote ethereum node using HTTP, IPC or WebSocket.
2. [Getting Started](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.11/getting-started.html)
3. [Web3-eth](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.11/web3-eth.html) - The web3-eth package allows you to interact with an Ethereum blockchain and Ethereum smart contracts.

### Querying Data in an Ethereum Blockchain
[Read/Write to an Ethereum Blockchain using Smart Contracts](https://medium.com/coinmonks/querying-data-in-an-ethereum-blockchain-86289d3fc385) - Ethereum Blockchain functioning is fairly straightforward, the different storage space for permanent and temporary data in different tries ensures that data is safe and the data is easily manageable. Therefore, enabling access to the data stored on the Ethereum blockchain safe and easy.

### GraphQL
GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.<br>
GraphQL queries access not just the properties of one resource but also smoothly follow references between them. While typical REST APIs require loading from multiple URLs, GraphQL APIs get all the data your app needs in a single request. Apps using GraphQL can be quick even on slow mobile network connections.<br>
