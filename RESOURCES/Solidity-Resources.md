#### Smart Contracts
Perhaps the best metaphor for a smart contract is a vending machine, as described by Nick Szabo. With the right inputs, a certain output is guaranteed.

- Smart Contract = back-end API running in the blockchain
- Dapp (Decentralized App) = front-end of the smart contract (visual application that allows the user to interact with the smart contract)

#### Solidity
A Smart Contract is deployed as byte code, but that does not imply you will have to write it that way. You will find various high-level languages in the community that compiles and converts your code to the EVM bytecode. The most popular one is Solidity. Solidity is an object-oriented and static language influenced by C++ or javascript.
