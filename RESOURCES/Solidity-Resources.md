### Solidity
A Smart Contract is deployed as byte code, but that does not imply you will have to write it that way. You will find various high-level languages in the community that compiles and converts your code to the EVM bytecode. The most popular one is Solidity. Solidity is an object-oriented, static, high-level language for implementing smart contracts, influenced by C++ and Javascript.

### Smart Contracts
Smart contracts are programs which govern the behaviour of accounts within the Ethereum state.<br>
Perhaps the best metaphor for a smart contract is a vending machine, as described by Nick Szabo. With the right inputs, a certain output is guaranteed.
- Smart Contract = back-end API running in the blockchain
- Dapp (Decentralized App) = front-end of the smart contract (visual application that allows the user to interact with the smart contract)

### Notes
#### Calling Smart Contract (RentalContract.Sol) from App.js Javascript File
- 2 Addresses - sender & receiver (these will be inputted by the landlord when setting up the smart contract)<br>
`const senderAddress = "0x..."`<br>
`const receiverAddress = "0x..."`<br>
- Use balance function to get the current amount at both addresses (`<address>.balance)
- Use call function to receive the result of executing the function
- Access instantiated smart contract methods through `yourContract.methods.methodname` (`contract.methods.methodname`)
- Send to transfer the ether
  
#### Special Variables and Functions
**Variables**<br>
`block.number` - current block number<br>
`msg.data` - complete calldata<br>
`msg.value` - number of wei sent with the message<br>
`msg.sender` - sender of the message (current call)<br>
`tx.origin` - sender of the transaction (full call chain)<br>
`tx.gasprice` - gas price of the transaction<br>
**Functions**<br>
`<address payable>.send(uint) returns (bool)` - send given amount of wei to address, returns false on failure, forwards 2300 gas stipend, not adjustable<br>
`<address payable>.transfer(uint)` - send given amount of wei to address, reverts on failure, forwards 2300 gas stipend, not adjustable<br>
`<address>.balance` - balance of the address in wei<br>
`<address>.call{value: someValue, gas: uint}(bytes) returns (bool, bytes)` - issue low-level call with the given payload, returns success condition and return data, forwards all available gas, adjustable<br>

#### Solidity - Send vs. Transfer
1. [Secure Ether Transfer](https://fravoll.github.io/solidity-patterns/secure_ether_transfer.html)
2. [Sending Ether](https://solidity-by-example.org/sending-ether/)
3. [Solidity - .send() vs .transfer()](https://vomtom.at/solidity-send-vs-transfer/)
4. [Solidity Smart Contract Tutorial With Building Real-World Dapp â€” Part 4: Transfer, Send and Call](https://medium.com/coinmonks/solidity-smart-contract-tutorial-with-building-real-world-dapp-part-4-transfer-send-and-call-ea9d7386114c)

You can send Ether to other contracts by:
1. transfer (2300 gas, throws error)
2. send (2300 gas, returns bool)
3. call (forward all gas or set gas, returns bool)

`require(<address>.send(amount))` is equal to `<address>.transfer(amount)`<br>
An overview over the differences of the three methods is given in the following table:

| Function    | Amount of Gas Forwarded        | Exception Propagation |
| ----------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------- |
| send        | 2300 (not adjustable)          | false on failure      |
| call.value  | all remaining gas (adjustable) | false on failure      |
| transfer    | 2300 (not adjustable)          | throws on failure     |

AS OF DECEMBER 2020: Recommended to use call() instead of transfer() or send()

#### Contract Related
`this` - the current contract, explicitly convertible to address<br>
`selfdestruct(address payable)` - Destroy the current contract, sending its funds to the given Address and end execution.<br>

#### Error Handling
`require(bool, string)` - Reverts if the condition is not met - to be used for errors in inputs or external components. Also provides an error message.<br>
`assert` - Causes a Panic error and thus state change reversion if the condition is not met - to be used for internal errors.<br>
`revert(string)` - abort execution and revert state changes, providing an explanatory string<br>

#### Address vs. Address Payable
The `address` and `address payable` types both store a 160-bit Ethereum address.<br>
Simply speaking, an address payable can receive Ether, while a plain address cannot.<br>
